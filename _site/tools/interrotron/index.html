<h1 class="posttitle league">Our Makeshift Interrotron</h1>

<p class="byline">posted by <a href="/phillips">Zach Phillips</a>

<p>Errol Morris is one of my favorite filmmakers. If you&#8217;ve never seen <em>The Thin Blue Line</em> or <em>The Fog of War</em> or <em>Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control</em>, you need to. His films are a unique cinematic experience, and it just so happens that the essential medium he uses to communicate, filmed interviews, is what we do all the time. (I would not compare our interviews for corporate videos to Morris&#8217;s brilliant work. It&#8217;s just a similar interaction between director, camera, and interviewee.)</p>

<p>One of the ways that Morris&#8217;s films feel so different and personal is that his subjects talk directly into the camera, creating a sense of eye contact for the audience. He accomplishes this using an invention he calls the <a href='http://www.errolmorris.com/content/eyecontact/interrotron.html'>Interrotron</a>, which is a piece of one-way glass put in front of the camera lens onto which he projects a video image of his face. This way, the interview subject can look at <em>Morris</em> (or the representation of him), and simultaneously be looking directly into the camera lens.</p>

<p>My former boss Jim Scherzi had an old teleprompter machine laying around that he hadn&#8217;t used in a while, and I asked if I could borrow it for the United Way shoot. Instead of putting words on the screen, I connected it to my Macbook and opened up Photobooth, putting my face on the screen for my interview subjects to look at as I asked them questions.</p>

<p>I was a little scared that they wouldn&#8217;t take to it (turns out <a href='http://www.errolmorris.com/content/eyecontact/interrotron.html'>Morris was scared at first too</a>), but it worked brilliantly.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re all used to seeing interviews done news-style, like a reverse shot in a narrative film where the character is talking off-camera to another character. In the case of the news, that&#8217;s Bob Costas. But in so many documentaries and certainly in the videos we make, the person we intend the interviewee to be speaking with is the audience itself.</p>

<p>To improve upon this, I&#8217;d like to get some bigger one-way glass (two pieces) and a couple of flat-panel monitors, so that both my subject and I can talk with natural eye contact. For this first trial run, I was forced to look at the iSight hole on my Macbook Air most of the time, which is a bit of an alienating experience. And then I was constantly checking my monitor which was mounted just above my screen, but still not <em>on</em> the lens itself, creating the same problem for my interviewees as the audience might have on conventionally shot interviews. The problem of distance. Lack of eye contact (the reason <a href='/eyeliner'>video chatting still sucks a whole lot more than being in person</a>).</p>

<p>So next time we do one of these, I&#8217;ll have an excuse to buy some new stuff! (and we get to build something)</p>

<p>After seeing the results, especially with the little boy Donald, who certainly could never talk directly into a camera with that kind of real, natural performance, I never want to do interviews the old way again.</p>
