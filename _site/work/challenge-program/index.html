<h1 class="posttitle league">The Challenge Program</h1>

<p class="byline">posted by <a href="/phillips">Zach Phillips</a>

<p>When I first got to Delaware, I balked for a long time at looking for Delaware clientele. I still had some clients in Atlanta and Syracuse, and the idea of starting over felt pretty daunting. But after a little while, it became evident that I should suck it up and go meet some people. I&#8217;m going to be here for a while (my fianc√© is an attorney specializing in corporate bankruptcy). So I decided I&#8217;d do something I&#8217;d sworn off a dozen times before: <strong>pro-bono work</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been burned a number of times doing free work, and so this time I thought I&#8217;d go about it a little differently. <em>I went and sought out the work myself</em>. This way, I could do the work on my own terms, make something I could be proud of, and never feel put-upon (not saying anyone doing pro-bono work ever feels put-upon&#8230;).</p>

<p>If I&#8217;m the one offering, and no one asked me to do it, then there&#8217;s little room for the messiness that sometimes happens, and if it still does, at least I only have myself to blame.</p>

<p>Well, I couldn&#8217;t have picked a better non-profit to volunteer with. <a href='http://challengeprogram.com'>The Challenge Program</a> is awesome, and I&#8217;ve made great friends there. <a href='http://houseind.com'>House Industries</a>, the legendary type foundry, is also friend of the program, and I started with a nice layout (and a web-license for Neutraface&#8230;!) from them.</p>

<p>At the time I did the site, <a href='http://ethanmarcotte.com'>Ethan Marcotte</a> had recently come out with <a href='http://responsivewebdesign.com'><em>Responsive Web Design</em></a> and the Twitters were all a-twitter (sorry). So I decided to make <a href='http://challengeprogram.org'>http://challengeprogram.org</a> my first responsive site.</p>

<p>I started building in Textpattern because House had already started setting up the site with it and I saw that <a href='http://hicksdesign.co.uk'>Jon Hicks</a> was a big fan. Hicks is an unbelievable designer, one of my heroes, but I&#8217;ve since learned to take any tool recommendations of his with a grain of salt. He has an Android phone, for one&#8230; by choice.</p>

<p>So Textpattern turned out to be a pretty big struggle to work with, especially since I already had done so much work with the much more powerful and plugin-rich ExpressionEngine. So I switched to EE and went about figuring out CSS3 media queries and fluid layouts. If you aren&#8217;t familar with responsive web design, open up the <a href='http://challengeprogram.org'>Challenge Program site</a> and make your browser window as narrow as you can. You&#8217;ll see the styling change as the viewport width changes. This makes the site pleasant to visit from all devices.</p>

<p>I now design almost every site I do responsively. I think that responsive needs to be the default position for all web design, and a designer needs to have a <em>very</em> good reason <em>not</em> to be responsive. About half of all web browsing now takes place on mobile devices, and that&#8217;s rising rapidly. I can&#8217;t believe major sites like the New York Times and others still have no consideration for the small screens of the world. It&#8217;s a complete dereliction and hostile to users.</p>

<p>More on responsive web design later&#8230;</p>

<p>I think this might be my favorite site I&#8217;ve done to date. It&#8217;s clean and white, Neutraface, responsive. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m really proud of, and definitely the best pro-bono experience I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>

<p>So if you are having trouble looking for work and need a project, find the coolest non-profit in your town, call them up and tell them you have some skills that might help them.</p>
