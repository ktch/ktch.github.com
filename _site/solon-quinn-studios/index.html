<h1 class="posttitle league">A Paper Leavebehind</h1>

<p class="byline">posted by <a href="/phillips">Zach Phillips</a>

<p>I got a call from an old friend back in Syracuse (a filmmaker named <a href='http://solonquinnstudios.com'>Solon Quinn</a>. He needed a creative leavebehind for an upcoming trip to New York City.</p>

<p>He, along with Benjamin Schechter (a very close friend of mine working as a producer with Solon&#8217;s company), would be touring the ad agencies, trying to find some higher profile (and higher paying) work than they were getting in Syracuse.</p>

<p>Originally, it was going to be a simple copywriting job, and after having our recorded conference call using <a href='http://campfirenow.com'>Campfire</a>, the message that came to light was &#8220;We are a small production house, and this is advantageous, because we are more nimble, more passionate, and with fewer account executives and less bureaucracy. We also make <a href='https://vimeo.com/28311976'>great stuff</a> and we have the tools to compete with any production values offered by the big guys you currently work with.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were on a very tight budget and an even tighter schedule, and the answer to this problem didn&#8217;t come very easily. And again&#8230; the budget.</p>

<p>So I was hanging out with <a href='http://geoffmatheson.com'>Geoff Matheson</a>, get-your-hands-dirty-design extraordinaire, and he kept talking about how &#8220;sometimes you need to just sit down and start folding paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is when the idea came. How small could we fold a large piece of newsprint down to?</p>

<p>From there it was some slick typography by <a href='http://kellysullan.com'>Kelly Sullan</a>, a big pad of newsprint, some custom X-acto cut stencils, 20 some-odd cans of spraypaint, and Geoff Matheson working his ass off for far too little money. But the result was awesome.</p>

<p>Included with the little package was a custom disk image burned to a seriously cool metal thumbdrive stamped with the company&#8217;s logo in white. Same drive you get with a <a href='/smallhd'>smallHD monitor</a>. The drive had examples of the studio&#8217;s work and a .webloc aiming at a fullpage javascript slideshow leading to their site. This way, not only could we track analytics on people who got the drives, but we could also update and change what they would see whenever we wanted. Also, PDF&#8217;s are never fun to open, and almost always look bad without user manipulation (zooming, etc.). PDF is an incredibly useful format, but not for promotion.</p>

<p><strong>A quick note for others attempting the custom .dmg:</strong> At the time we did this, it was not possible to have the disk automatically pop open when inserted into the USB port. This is a security feature of Mac OS X and (we assume) other operating systems. So although we were able to get the custom installer-style folder to work (using <a href='https://store.araelium.com/home/'>DMG Canvas</a>&#8230; not a great app but it works and it&#8217;s cheap), we couldn&#8217;t get the <em>exact</em> interaction we wanted.</p>
