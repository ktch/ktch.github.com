<h1 class="posttitle league">Style Icons with Manuel Schnatter</h1>

<p class="byline">posted by <a href="/phillips">Zach Phillips</a>

<p>Dan Frigolette and I lived on the same floor freshman year at Syracuse. Since then, he&#8217;s gone on to be a full-time comedian and promoter.</p>

<p>We also both happen to be from the Syracuse area. One day when we were both home visiting family, Dan called me up and asked if we could shoot a quick comedy sketch. We had little in mind other than a character he had been working on named Manuel &#8220;Benny&#8221; Schnatter.</p>

<p>We spent the afternoon together and this is what we made.</p>

<h1 class="posttitle league">the Kitchen Logo</h1>

<p class="byline">posted by <a href="/phillips">Zach Phillips</a>

<p>If it&#8217;s true that <a href='http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs'>design is how it works</a>, then that&#8217;s the kind of designer I would consider myself. Though I&#8217;ve done quite a bit of visual design in my life, including this site, I&#8217;ve not had much formal training in proper graphic design and typography, so when it came time to create a mark for my new company, I felt I needed to go with <a href='http://twitter.com/bradwason'>a pro</a>. Luckily, Brad Wason, at the time heading 23rd&amp;5th, needed a quick video done for a pro-bono client of his, so I was able to barter my work on that video towards the creation of what would become the logo for the Kitchen.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a damned good thing I hired Brad for the job, because the ideas I was sketching are embarrassing to look back at. Brad was very professional in taking me through a proper questionaire, which I snarled at and ripped up because it made me think about stuff I didn&#8217;t want to think about.</p>

<p>In our first meeting, I said all the vague, generic words that you say (&#8220;I want it to be like super slick and modern, but evoke tradition and the past, and I want it to be clean and timeless, and I want it to be one color but maybe lots of colors&#8230; etc.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Anyways, the experience made me really identify with some of my clients. Sometimes, you really just <em>don&#8217;t know</em> what you want, and often this problem can arise on the projects most important and central to your business. Sometimes you&#8217;re just too close, and this was definitely the case with me and my company&#8217;s oh-so-important mark that will of course go on to be stamped on everything and to live forever as an indelible historic brand.</p>

<p>Brad came back with two versions. One really slick, and the other really friendly. I wanted both slick and friendly, so we made &#8220;a Frankenstein monster&#8221; (as Brad calls it) out of both of them.</p>

<p>Oh. And I love it. I love it so much. It soothes me sometimes just to look at it. This is why, sometimes, you just have to hire a pro.</p>
