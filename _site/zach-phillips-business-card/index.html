<h1 class="posttitle league">A (Slightly) Interactive Business Card</h1>

<p class="byline">posted by <a href="/phillips">Zach Phillips</a>

<p>Before I opened the Kitchen, I was working as a freelance consultant, and so I needed a business card.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure no one else has ever done this, but I would spend dozens of hours looking through coolest-business-card-ever websites and Flickr albums, fawning over the creativity of a divorce lawyer&#8217;s card with a clever perforation down the middle or a $10 card made of stainless steel.</p>

<p>My perfectionism has led me to create no fewer than ten different business cards, none of which were ever printed. So one day when I was driving to Syracuse from Atlanta (by way of Cincinnati), I declared that by the end of that day, I would have a concept for a business card, and by the end of the following day, the card would be off to the printers.</p>

<p>The reason I had picked this day is because I would be with my grandfather <a href='http://zach.be/2011/10/truman-toland-1922-2011/'>Truman Toland</a>, the most skilled artist I&#8217;ve ever known, for a nine-hour drive.</p>

<p>So we brainstormed. I said I wanted it to be different. Not just a pretty card, but a card that <em>did</em> something. At the very least, a card that would be memorable, that someone would stop to look at or interact with for a moment.</p>

<p>I also did not want to pigeonhole myself into any particular medium. My main background was in film, but I&#8217;d done a lot of photography and by that time I was pretty deep into ExpressionEngine development. The jack-of-all-trades label of course comes with a negative addendum, but I just wasn&#8217;t yet willing to say &#8220;This thing is what I will do forever.&#8221; <a href='/medium-independence'>I&#8217;m still not</a>.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and I wanted some glossy rounded squares on it, because rounded squares are all the rage, you know?</p>

<p>So the title I came up with for myself (with the help of Steven Berman, a friend in Atlanta) was Creative Consultant. This title, in theory, would leave me open to all kinds of work.</p>

<p>The message of the card would be that I could offer simple creative solutions to problems, so Grandpa Truman remembered an animation he had created on his Amiga back in the 80&#8217;s, with a character who had (literally) painted himself into a corner. He had animated several versions of this concept where the character finds a way out. We figured we could create a three-panel comic out of one of these concepts, and we could put that comic in my glossy rounded squares.</p>

<p>Then, to add an interactive element, we would have a sticker over the usual contact info, with a message to peel back the sticker for &#8220;simple, creative solutions.&#8221;</p>

<p>With spot-gloss, rounded corners, and the stickers, the whole thing cost less than $100 (for five hundred cards and stickers). Got them printed at <a href='http://overnightprints.com'>OvernightPrints.com</a>. The stickers I got from some guy in Colorado. The spot-gloss didn&#8217;t come out perfectly on every card, but man was it cheap and they really look great.</p>

<p>Now that there&#8217;s the Kitchen, I don&#8217;t use this card anymore, but I&#8217;m still pretty proud of it.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t know Adobe Illustrator very well, but my grandpa sat for a few hours, patiently translating his sketch for me with the pen tool, and since he died last fall, this card will always serve as a nice reminder of him.</p>
