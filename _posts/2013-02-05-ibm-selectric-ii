synopsis: A fun, self-promotional product piece about a tool we love.

This is a self-promotional piece we did.

We're really only half joking. We do love this typewriter in real life and use it for client correspondence among other things.

There's something about the way a typewriter allows you to create a beautiful, tactile, and orderly object as you hit the keys—the way it punches the letters into the paper—that makes it a special experience. And the Selectric is the king of electric typewriters, in terms of design, engineering, and longevity. This Selectric is from 1973, and it looks fantastic (it works great too!). It is one of those truly timeless, iconic designs.

A distinctive aspect of the Selectric is the _ka-chunk_, the very loud and robotic sounds it makes. That's the sound of work being _done_. Naturally, the only fitting musical choice was dubstep.

We haven't done many product films yet, and it's something we'd like to get more into, and so this was an exercise for us and a demonstration for potential clients.

Hope this is as fun for you to watch as it was foror us to make.
