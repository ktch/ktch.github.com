Angelo's Luncheonette is a little place on the corner in the 40 Acres (near Trolley Square). Muzzi, the owner, has worked here for 45 years. When you walk into the place, it feels like you've gone back in time.

We decided to shoot a little video to try and capture the essence of the place. It was a great time.

This is one of the friendliest places you'll ever walk into.
