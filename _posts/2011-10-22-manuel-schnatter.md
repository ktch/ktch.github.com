synopsis: A silly character study with stand-up comedian/promoter Dan Frigolette.

Dan Frigolette and I lived on the same floor freshman year at Syracuse. Since then, he's gone on to be a full-time comedian and promoter.

We also both happen to be from the Syracuse area. One day when we were both home visiting family, Dan called me up and asked if we could shoot a quick comedy sketch. We had little in mind other than a character he had been working on named Manuel "Benny" Schnatter.

We spent the afternoon together and this is what we made.
