When I moved to Delaware a few years ago, I didn't know anyone, and
so I went looking for an interesting non-profit to volunteer for and
hopefully meet some good people in the process.

I'm so happy that interesting non-profit wound up being the
[Challenge Program](http://challengeprogram.org). It is
seriously one of the coolest places and warmest groups of people I've
ever come across.

This video involved the participation of so many people, including Jeff
Goldstein and Jamie Unkefer from [Digsau](http://digsau.com),
Aimee Olexy of [Talula's Table](http://talulastable.com) and [Talula's
Garden](http://talulasgarden.com), and Charlie Copeland. It was a long
time in the making, but we're really happy with the result.

Keep an eye out for more Challenge Program videos, as they have a
lot more stories to tell, and we've got a lot more material in the can.
