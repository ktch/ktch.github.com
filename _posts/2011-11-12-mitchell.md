We participated in a commercial competition put on by the Delaware Independent Filmmakers and the [Newark Film Festival](http://newarkfilm.com).

The contest is a pretty interesting concept, as it gives each major sponsor of the festival its own ad, which runs before each screening. The filmmakers who are competing get to put their work on the big screen and stand to win some money, the sponsors get a 30-second spot for themselves, and the festival gets a nice way to plug the sponsors.

Each filmmaker is assigned a client based on a lottery, and I was given [Mitchell Associates](http://mitchellai.com), a pretty big interior design/architecture firm here in Wilmington.

Mitchell was awesome to work with, and I think we got a pretty nice spot out of this. Only part I'm dubious about is the voiceover, which is my first ever attempt at recording myself...

The music was composed and produced in a pinch by the ever-so-talented [Elizabeth Luttinger](http://eluttinger.com) out in Los Angeles.

Also, we won. Not a big deal.
