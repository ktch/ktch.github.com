When I was in college, I wanted to get a catchy domain for myself, so I purchased carsgirlsandsurfing.com, and truthfully, I was and still am tremendously surprised it was available. I know I'm not the only Beach Boys fan in the world.

I had put a site up at the time created totally in Fireworks, so basically a big, cut up GIF in a table, with some simple javascript rollover behavior I learned in a web class I was auditing, and I proceeded to do nothing ever with the site other than make [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS-UZGucMSU) a couple years later when my friend Peter was skunked out of his house and staying on my couch (more on that video and the skunk incident someday).

But I kept paying the domain registration and to this day I have high hopes for what the site could someday be. It's just such a great name to me! (I'm probably the only one)

Well, [here it is](http://carsgirlsandsurfing.com). A podcast network! (Everyone should have their own podcast network...)

Not many shows there yet, and the quality isn't good, but I have a lot of plans for it, including traditional hour-long talk shows and short web series that we come up with. You can think of the Cars, Girls, and Surfing syndicate as the breakroom at the Kitchen, or the steps out back by the dumpster where you go to have a cigarette on a slow night. More or less, it's the place where I will try to be less judgmental (right). It's just hobby stuff, for fun, and like the Buddists say, it isn't good or bad. It just is.

Made some cool stuff for it though, including a javascript HTML5 record player that works well on both mobile and desktop. [Check it out](http://carsgirlsandsurfing.com/meditating/1/). I started with [a prototype built by Pedro Duarte](http://pedroduarte.me/lab/turntable/) and added some functionality to it like a skip forward and back 30 seconds (essential to podcast listening in my opinion).

It's responsive (of course), built on Jekyll, and may be the first and last time I feel justified in using Cooper Black.

Still needs a lot of work (no judgment).
