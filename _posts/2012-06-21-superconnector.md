It was fantastic working with the United Way of Delaware on this video, and the immensely talented [Brad Wason](/kitchen-logo) of DMG Marketing, even though we were a bit time-crunched (we put this video together, production and post-production, in less than two weeks).

We hit some new milestones with this video, including a full move to Final Cut X, which I will do a post about later. I've concluded that, though flawed, FCPX is pretty great software, and the things that make me crazy about it (hello "Share" menu...) are outweighed by great new features, some of which (sigh) did indeed come from iMovie.

This was also our first time using our makeshift [Interrotron](/tools/interrotron), which I think had a tremendous impact on the performance of the interviewees, and adds a lot to the emotional impact of the piece.
