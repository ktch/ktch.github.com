synopsis: A different take on a college promotional video. We asked Delaware College of Art and Design students if they would teach us something they've learned.

This video came up about a week and a half before [DCAD](http://dcad.edu) students would be leaving for the summer, so we needed a concept we could execute production on very quickly.

The question we asked each of the ten students we interviewed is: "What can you teach a potential incoming DCAD student in a minute or less?" After pre-screening a bunch of students, we found ourselves left with ten ideas we thought were pretty great, and we went about shooting them the following day.

This was our first shoot with the [Sound Devices 702](http://sounddevices.com/products/702/) recorder, which we used in concert with our [Sound Devices 302](http://www.sounddevices.com/products/302/). If you have the means, I really recommend it.

Sorry for that, but they're just (OH MY GOD) so nice.
