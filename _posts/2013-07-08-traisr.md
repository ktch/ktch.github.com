synopsis: A slick little software intro and our first time teaming up with essentia creative

We got a call from [essentia creative](http://essentiacreative.com) about doing a short animation with them. Shannon Stevens and team were a pleasure to work with and we got it out on a short deadline for the product release.

This piece was created using Adobe After Effects CC, and though there were some quirks, I found the round-tripping between Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects to be really useful and time-saving as we iterated on these assets. Let's just say that it's come a long way.

(The last time I used After Effects, Illustrator wasn't integrated at all, only Photoshop, which always seemed totally wrong. The way it deals with vectors could still be better, but Illustrator is a much more natural app to be using for animation assets than Photoshop.)

The golden voice is [Brett Donnelly](http://brettstuff.com), a man of great character and refined tastes, who nailed it on the first take as he is accustomed to doing.
