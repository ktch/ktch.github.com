synopsis: A web spot in collaboration with essentia creative, where we were tasked with creating Europe on Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware

This was a great shoot at [La Fia](http://lafiawilmington.com) with [essentia](http://essentiacreative.com). It was about 20 degrees out but luckily we had sun and were able to create a believable European setting.

Voiceover is by the extremely talented [Roger Stevens](http://www.procommvoices.com/listen_profile.php?rec_id=5887) and music is by [Elizabeth Luttinger](http://elizabitcrusher.com), who was able to adapt the Barclaycard brand sonic to a soundtrack from an Italian caf√©.
