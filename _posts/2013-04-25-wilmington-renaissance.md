synopsis: A motion-graphics piece we did in concert with ab+c Creative Intelligence about an organization working hard, and succeeding, to revitalize our fair city
---

We were contacted by the good people over at [Wilmington Renaissance Corporation](http://bigideaswilmington.com) about doing a piece for their annual meeting. Something to run on the screen to open the event and then also a calling card piece for the mission-driven organization to put up on their website.

The challenge was to create a piece that would really enhance WRC's new brand, and at a very low cost. So we came up with a concept that would involve no shooting, utilize some kinetic typography, a voiceover, and the designs already in progress for their rebranding.

The script was read by the great [Brady Hales](http://bradyhales.com/), Greg Truono did the animation within Apple's Motion 5 (we need to write a post about our experience with Motion soon), and the design concept was adapted from the great work done by the folks over at [ab+c Creative Intelligence](http://a-b-c.com).

We're really happy with the way it came out and it was great to work with WRC. Also looking forward to doing a lot more motion graphics work in the future.
