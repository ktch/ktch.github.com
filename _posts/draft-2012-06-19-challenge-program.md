synopsis: Some thoughts on doing pro-bono work, and our first responsive web design.
---

When I first got to Delaware, I balked for a long time at looking for Delaware clientele. I still had some clients in Atlanta and Syracuse, and the idea of starting over felt pretty daunting. But after a little while, it became evident that I should suck it up and go meet some people. I'm going to be here for a while (my fianc√© is an attorney specializing in corporate bankruptcy). So I decided I'd do something I'd sworn off a dozen times before: **pro-bono work**.

I've been burned a number of times doing free work, and so this time I thought I'd go about it a little differently. _I went and sought out the work myself_. This way, I could do the work on my own terms, make something I could be proud of, and never feel put-upon (not saying anyone doing pro-bono work ever feels put-upon...).

If I'm the one offering, and no one asked me to do it, then there's little room for the messiness that sometimes happens, and if it still does, at least I only have myself to blame.

Well, I couldn't have picked a better non-profit to volunteer with. [The Challenge Program](http://challengeprogram.com) is awesome, and I've made great friends there. [House Industries](http://houseind.com), the legendary type foundry, is also friend of the program, and I started with a nice layout (and a web-license for Neutraface...!) from them.

At the time I did the site, [Ethan Marcotte](http://ethanmarcotte.com) had recently come out with [_Responsive Web Design_](http://responsivewebdesign.com) and the Twitters were all a-twitter (sorry). So I decided to make [http://challengeprogram.org](http://challengeprogram.org) my first responsive site.

I started building in Textpattern because House had already started setting up the site with it and I saw that [Jon Hicks](http://hicksdesign.co.uk) was a big fan. Hicks is an unbelievable designer, one of my heroes, but I've since learned to take any tool recommendations of his with a grain of salt. He has an Android phone, for one... by choice.

So Textpattern turned out to be a pretty big struggle to work with, especially since I already had done so much work with the much more powerful and plugin-rich ExpressionEngine. So I switched to EE and went about figuring out CSS3 media queries and fluid layouts. If you aren't familar with responsive web design, open up the [Challenge Program site](http://challengeprogram.org) and make your browser window as narrow as you can. You'll see the styling change as the viewport width changes. This makes the site pleasant to visit from all devices.

I now design almost every site I do responsively. I think that responsive needs to be the default position for all web design, and a designer needs to have a _very_ good reason _not_ to be responsive. About half of all web browsing now takes place on mobile devices, and that's rising rapidly. I can't believe major sites like the New York Times and others still have no consideration for the small screens of the world. It's a complete dereliction and hostile to users.

More on responsive web design later...

I think this might be my favorite site I've done to date. It's clean and white, Neutraface, responsive. It's something I'm really proud of, and definitely the best pro-bono experience I've ever had.

So if you are having trouble looking for work and need a project, find the coolest non-profit in your town, call them up and tell them you have some skills that might help them.
