synopsis: YMCA of Delaware put us up in a cabin for a memorable shoot where we tried to capture the magic of Camp Tockwogh
---

This past summer, we went down to [YMCA Camp Tockwogh](http://www.ymcade.org/branches/tockwogh/) for a series of 95 degree days and a really enjoyable outdoor shoot.

They were nice enough to put us up in a cabin and it's a shoot we're all definitely going to remember.

I wanted to capture the feeling and nostalgia of camp for campers both past and present, and I'm really happy with how this turned out. One of the things we paid special attention to on this shoot was the capture of sound, using our Rode NT4 stereo mic and Sound Devices setup.
The music is by [Elizabeth Luttinger](http://elizabitcrusher.com/).
