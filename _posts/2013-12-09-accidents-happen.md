synopsis: A series of TV spots for Delaware's implementation of the Affordable Care Act, produced in collaboration with ab+c Creative Intelligence

It's been a little while now since we've done these spots, but I had
hoped to have our new site up in time to show them off.

Alas, that hasn't happened, but I wanted to have the latest stuff up on
the site, so I won't do a long description of these now, except to say
that [ab+c Creative Intelligence](http://a-b-c.com/) was a total
pleasure to work with on these, and this shoot was a ton of fun.

It was also our company's first shoot with the [RED
Epic](http://red.com).

The new site will have detailed descriptions and credits for all our
stuff.
