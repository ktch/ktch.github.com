Before I opened the Kitchen, I was working as a freelance consultant, and so I needed a business card.

I'm sure no one else has ever done this, but I would spend dozens of hours looking through coolest-business-card-ever websites and Flickr albums, fawning over the creativity of a divorce lawyer's card with a clever perforation down the middle or a $10 card made of stainless steel.

My perfectionism has led me to create no fewer than ten different business cards, none of which were ever printed. So one day when I was driving to Syracuse from Atlanta (by way of Cincinnati), I declared that by the end of that day, I would have a concept for a business card, and by the end of the following day, the card would be off to the printers.

The reason I had picked this day is because I would be with my grandfather [Truman Toland](http://zach.be/2011/10/truman-toland-1922-2011/), the most skilled artist I've ever known, for a nine-hour drive.

So we brainstormed. I said I wanted it to be different. Not just a pretty card, but a card that _did_ something. At the very least, a card that would be memorable, that someone would stop to look at or interact with for a moment.

I also did not want to pigeonhole myself into any particular medium. My main background was in film, but I'd done a lot of photography and by that time I was pretty deep into ExpressionEngine development. The jack-of-all-trades label of course comes with a negative addendum, but I just wasn't yet willing to say "This thing is what I will do forever." [I'm still not](/medium-independence).

Oh yeah, and I wanted some glossy rounded squares on it, because rounded squares are all the rage, you know?

So the title I came up with for myself (with the help of Steven Berman, a friend in Atlanta) was Creative Consultant. This title, in theory, would leave me open to all kinds of work.

The message of the card would be that I could offer simple creative solutions to problems, so Grandpa Truman remembered an animation he had created on his Amiga back in the 80's, with  a character who had (literally) painted himself into a corner. He had animated several versions of this concept where the character finds a way out. We figured we could create a three-panel comic out of one of these concepts, and we could put that comic in my glossy rounded squares.

Then, to add an interactive element, we would have a sticker over the usual contact info, with a message to peel back the sticker for "simple, creative solutions."

With spot-gloss, rounded corners, and the stickers, the whole thing cost less than $100 (for five hundred cards and stickers). Got them printed at [OvernightPrints.com](http://overnightprints.com). The stickers I got from some guy in Colorado. The spot-gloss didn't come out perfectly on every card, but man was it cheap and they really look great.

Now that there's the Kitchen, I don't use this card anymore, but I'm still pretty proud of it.

He didn't know Adobe Illustrator very well, but my grandpa sat for a few hours, patiently translating his sketch for me with the pen tool, and since he died last fall, this card will always serve as a nice reminder of him.
