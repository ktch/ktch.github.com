synopsis: We made a Jersey Mike's Subs commercial with Scherzi Studios that brings us back to the feel-good commercials of our youth.

Last year, we traveled out to Los Angeles and drove about an hour north of the city to the charming town of Ojai (pronounced "Oh, Hi!") to shoot a television spot for [Jersey Mike's Subs](http://jerseymikes.com).

You may not know about Mike's if they aren't in your area, but over the last several years, they've opened something like 600 stores nationwide.

I had come up with a concept based on a lot of the brand strategy I'd seen them implementing over the years I worked for [Scherzi Studios](http://scherzi.com). The concept was to make a spot that harkened back to some of the spots I remember from childhood. [One in particular](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex2DJnvyFsI) I remember was for Pizza Hut and really left an impression about Pizza Hut being a kid- and family-friendly place that supports local kids.

Well, that's what Jersey Mike's message is all about, so on a whim I just scratched out this concept about a magical submarine sandwich that fixes up the playground at a distressed school.

In casting, I was definitely looking for someone a little less whitebread blond and blue eyed, but Taylor was so good that she won handily.
