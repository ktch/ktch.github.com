synopsis: Our first foray into high-speed footage, and a really awesome subject
---

This piece was sort of a happy accident. We were shooting a larger video for the [YMCA of Delaware](http://ymcade.org), but we loved the footage we got from Cordell's section so much that we made a piece just from that.

This was also our first time using the [K5600 800 watt Joker Bug](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/192705-REG/K5600_K0800JB_Joker_Bug_800_Watt_HMI.html), which along with our Kino-flos allowed us to get that beautiful light in the pool area.

The underwater GoPro also makes an appearance.
