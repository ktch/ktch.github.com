Sometimes you take a low-paying project from a non-profit just because it sounds like it's going to be fun. This was one of those projects.

The [Jane Austen Society of North America, Eastern Pennsylvania Region](http://www.jasnaeastpa.org/) (not to be confused with the Jane Austen Society of North America, Western Pennsylvania Region...) wanted to put together some little 15-30 second videos to promote their big Jane Austen Day event.

I did not know how much Jane Austen hysteria was going on around the nation and here in our own back yard, and just to warn you, these little spots epitomize the "inside joke."

I really liked doing this project and what a _killer_ voiceover from [Nick Smith](http://voice123.com/francissmith1).
