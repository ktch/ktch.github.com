The Atlanta Hawks and BP came to us via [mobilezen](http://mobilezen.com) and wanted to do a mobile sweepstakes at a few games during the 2011-2012 season.

They would have been satisfied with something as simple as a Wufoo implementation or an email or SMS auto-response, but I had an idea I thought would be perfect for this, and would make the interaction infinitely more fun for the customers: a scratchoff game!

Afterwards, [we built the game into a fully-functioning Rails app](/projects/scratchoff). You can create your own promotion, create your look, your prizes, set the odds and inventory numbers, choose a sub-domain and you're rolling.

[Scratchoff.me](http://scratchoff.me) is released in partnership with mobilezen, who is handling sales, billing, and support, while the Kitchen gets to focus only on making the product as delightful as possible.
