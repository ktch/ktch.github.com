If it's true that [design is how it works](http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs), then that's the kind of designer I would consider myself. Though I've done quite a bit of visual design in my life, including this site, I've not had much formal training in proper graphic design and typography, so when it came time to create a mark for my new company, I felt I needed to go with [a pro](http://twitter.com/bradwason). Luckily, Brad Wason, at the time heading 23rd&5th, needed a quick video done for a pro-bono client of his, so I was able to barter my work on that video towards the creation of what would become the logo for the Kitchen.

It's a damned good thing I hired Brad for the job, because the ideas I was sketching are embarrassing to look back at. Brad was very professional in taking me through a proper questionaire, which I snarled at and ripped up because it made me think about stuff I didn't want to think about.

In our first meeting, I said all the vague, generic words that you say ("I want it to be like super slick and modern, but evoke tradition and the past, and I want it to be clean and timeless, and I want it to be one color but maybe lots of colors... etc.")

Anyways, the experience made me really identify with some of my clients. Sometimes, you really just _don't know_ what you want, and often this problem can arise on the projects most important and central to your business. Sometimes you're just too close, and this was definitely the case with me and my company's oh-so-important mark that will of course go on to be stamped on everything and to live forever as an indelible historic brand.

Brad came back with two versions. One really slick, and the other really friendly. I wanted both slick and friendly, so we made "a Frankenstein monster" (as Brad calls it) out of both of them.

Oh. And I love it. I love it so much. It soothes me sometimes just to look at it. This is why, sometimes, you just have to hire a pro.
