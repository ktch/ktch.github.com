synopsis: United Way of Delaware called to inform us they had received a hamster costume in a burlap sack from Peru, and that they wanted to make a video

[United Way of Delaware](http://uwde.org/) bought a hamster costume from Peru, and it arrived in a burlap sack. Then they called us.

We were a little wary of this project at first, as I tried to explain that we wouldn't be able to make a costume behave anything like a 3D-animated character. So when it came time to write this spot, I wanted to make sure that we drew a clear line of distinction between this character and the famous ones that everyone (apparently, other than me) knows.

The shoot turned out to be an incredibly enjoyable experience, and we're very happy with the final result.

We got a lot of help with this spot, and we need to thank them. For one, [DART](http://www.dartfirststate.com/) could not have been any more helpful. We weren't sure we were going to be able to pull off our bus scenes, and even thought about shooting them guerilla-style, just board one of the Market Street Trolleys and hope no one yelled at us. We were foolish to worry. Not only was DART glad to help, but they gave us a bus and a driver for the whole morning, and on extremely short notice.

[Parcels](http://parselsinc.com) provided the confetti, which was just the leftovers from the hole punching machine. Worked perfectly. If you need any of that, they've got garbage bags full of the stuff.

Steve Gold was a real trooper playing the hamster character, which we named Hamilton, and after putting on the costume for less than an hour one day, I have a renewed respect for what mascots must be going through.

[Nate Farrar](http://www.myspace.com/whirledblues), [Tom Spiker](http://tomspiker.virb.com/), and [Calvin Weston](http://www.myspace.com/calvinweston) recorded the music for us and that amazing voice you hear belongs to [David Milligan](http://www.voices.com/people/dmill) of Philadelphia.

Also, a big shout-out to our favorite member of the Wilmington Police Department, Mike Wilkerson.
